1. Create an instance, install apache server and add an index.html file and view that file in
the browser. Take snapshot of this instance and deploy it in another region.
Deliverable: Mention the steps for achieving this

STEPS

1. Launch an ec2 instance

     Choose ami,choose vpc,subnet,add tags,security group etc,.
     create a new key pair and download it or choose existing key pair if you have
     go to SSH and launch the ec2 server using its public IP and private key
    IMP: in rules,add a rule to allow HTTP traffic of port 80 also.
    IMP: The VPC should have Edit DNS hostname, Edit DNS resolution as Enable.

2. Install the apache server using the command
     
     $ sudo yum -y httpd

3. Launch apache server using the command
    
     $ sudo service httpd start

4. install amazon efs on ec2 and mount it using your file system id (also create a file system in Amazon EFS and get file system id)

    $ sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
    $ sudo mount -t efs fs-54b725ff:/ /var/www/html/efs

5. create a new directory 
     
     $ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/efs
     $ cd /var/www/html/efs

6. make a  subdirectory sample and attach index.html file to it using file upload
     
    $ sudo mkdir sample
    $ sudo chown  ec2-user sample
    $ sudo chmod -R o+r sample
    $ cd sample
    create index.html file and upload here.
7. open the browser and enter this url file to view index.html

   http://fs-54b725ff/efs/sample/hello.html

8. go to Ec2 console and then to snapshots
   create new snapshot by spectfying the ec2 instance

9. copy the snapshot and select any other region to deploy it there

10. go to the destination region to check the snapshot is created there or not.
    If it is created then done.
